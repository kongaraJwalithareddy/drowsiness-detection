**Overview** <br>
This project is aimed at developing a drowsiness detection system using computer vision techniques. The system monitors the driver's facial features in real-time to detect signs of drowsiness, such as eye closure and head movement, and alerts the driver to prevent potential accidents.
<br> <br>
**Features** <br>
Real-time detection of driver drowsiness using a webcam or video feed. <br>
Facial landmark detection to track key features such as eyes and mouth. <br>
Detection of indicators of drowsiness, such as eye closure. <br>
Audio or visual alerts to notify the driver when drowsiness is detected. <br>
Customizable alert thresholds and parameters for fine-tuning the system. <br>

**Dependencies** <br>
Python 3.x <br>
OpenCV <br>
dlib <br>
NumPy <br>

**Usage** <br>
Clone this repository to your local machine. <br>
Install the required dependencies such as shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat <br>
Run the drowsiness detection script: python drowsiness_detection.py. <br>
Ensure that a webcam or video feed is available for real-time monitoring. <br>
Customize alert thresholds and parameters as needed. <br>
